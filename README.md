# ðŸŽ¯ Bouncing Balls Animation

A simple, interactive HTML5 Canvas animation simulating physics-based bouncing balls with varying properties.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Two Ball Types:**
  - **Heavy Balls**: Experience stronger gravity (`0.7`) with a bounce coefficient of `0.8`.
  - **Light Balls**: Experience weaker gravity (`0.06`) with a bounce coefficient of `0.9`.
  
- **Randomized Behavior:**
  - Each ball has unique initial velocities and colors.
  - Dynamic wall collision detection and bounce response.

- **Interactive Reset**: 
  - Click the "Reset" button to restart the animation anytime.

## ðŸŽ® Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.
2. Watch the balls bounce with distinct physical properties!
3. Click the "Reset" button to refresh the animation.

## ðŸ“‚ Code Structure

- **`HeavyBall` Class**: Defines the properties and behavior for heavy balls.
- **`LightBall` Class**: Defines the properties and behavior for light balls.
- **`gameLoop` Function**: Manages the animation frame updates and rendering.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows restarting the simulation via a button click.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Ideas for potential enhancements:

- Ball-to-ball collisions for more complex physics.
- User-controlled ball properties for customization.
- Add new balls with a click.
- Customize ball colors.
- Drag and drop functionality for interacting with the balls.


**Enjoy watching the physics in action!**
