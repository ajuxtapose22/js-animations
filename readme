# Bouncing Balls Animation

A simple HTML5 Canvas animation demonstrating physics-based bouncing balls with different properties.
Overview
This project creates an interactive animation of bouncing balls with different physical properties:

Heavy balls with stronger gravity
Light balls with weaker gravity
Random initial velocities
Wall collision detection
Reset functionality

## Features

Two types of balls:

Heavy Balls: Higher gravity (.7) and bounce coefficient of .8
Light Balls: Lower gravity (.06) and bounce coefficient of .9


Each ball has:

Random initial velocity
Wall collision detection and response
Unique colors


Reset button to restart animation

## Usage

Open index.html in a web browser
Watch the balls bounce with different physics properties
Click the "Reset" button to restart the animation

## Code Structure

HeavyBall class: Creates balls with higher gravity
LightBall class: Creates balls with lower gravity
gameLoop: Handles animation updates and rendering
Event listener for reset functionality

## Future Improvements

Potential additions:

Ball-to-ball collisions
User-controlled ball properties
Click to add new balls
Color customization
Drag and drop functionality
